A couple notes:

The highscores are preserved inside of a data structure inside the gameLoop (it is not preserve on the DOM.)
Every time the maze is complete, the highscores are re-written.

How to use:
	There isn't too much to it:
		1) open index.html
		2) on the right hand side of the screen, select a maze size
		3) optional: toggle different options (described in the menu navigation)
		4) move the player in the maze with AWDS/JILK

If you have any question please let me know!
